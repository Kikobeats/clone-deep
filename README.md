# clone-deep [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/clone-deep.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/clone-deep)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/clone-deep.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/clone-deep)

> Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.

The `instanceClone` function is invoked to clone objects that are not "plain" objects (as defined by [](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`) if it is provided. If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i clone-deep --save
```

## Usage

```js
var cloneDeep = require('clone-deep');

var obj = {a: 'b'};
var arr = [obj];

var copy = cloneDeep(arr);
obj.c = 'd';

console.log(copy);
//=> [{a: 'b'}]

console.log(arr);
//=> [{a: 'b', c: 'd'}]
```
